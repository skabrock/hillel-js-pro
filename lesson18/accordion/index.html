        Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for
        documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted
        by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting
        languages such as JavaScript.

        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for
        describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language
        such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web,
        alongside HTML and JavaScript.

        JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that
        conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level,
        often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket
        syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and
        first-class functions.

        React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is an open-source, front end,
        JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components. It is
        maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and
        companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page
        or mobile applications. However, React is only concerned with rendering
        data to the DOM, and so creating React applications usually requires the
        use of additional libraries for state management and routing. Redux and
        React Router are respective examples of such libraries.
